[GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) is a popular media framework used by a multitude of cameras and video sources to create custom media pipelines by combining modular plugins\. The Kinesis Video Streams GStreamer plugin greatly simplifies the integration of your existing GStreamer media pipeline with Kinesis Video Streams\. After integrating GStreamer, you can get started with streaming video from a webcam or RTSP \(Real Time Streaming Protocol\) camera to Kinesis Video Streams for real\-time or later playback, storage, and further analysis\. 

The GStreamer plugin automatically manages the transfer of your video stream to Kinesis Video Streams by encapsulating the functionality provided by the Kinesis Video Streams Producer SDK in a GStreamer sink element, `kvssink`\. The GStreamer framework provides a standard managed environment for constructing media flow from a device such as a camera or other video source for further processing, rendering, or storage\. 

The GStreamer pipeline typically consists of the link between a source \(video camera\) and the sink element \(either a player to render the video, or storage for offline retrieval\)\. In this example, you use the Producer SDK element as a *sink*, or media destination, for your video source \(webcam or IP camera\)\. The plugin element that encapsulates the SDK then manages sending the video stream to Kinesis Video Streams\. 

This topic shows how to construct a GStreamer media pipeline capable of streaming video from a video source, such as a web camera or RTSP stream, typically connected through intermediate encoding stages \(using H\.264 encoding\) to Kinesis Video Streams\. When your video stream is available as a Kinesis video stream, you can use the Kinesis Video Stream Parser Library for further processing, playback, storage, or analysis of your video stream\.

## Download, Build, and Configure the GStreamer Element<a name="examples-gstreamer-plugin-download"></a>

The GStreamer Plugin example is included with the Kinesis Video Streams C\+\+ Producer SDK\. For information about SDK prerequisites and downloading, see [Step 1: Download and Configure the C\+\+ Producer Library Code](producersdk-cpp-download.md)\.

To build the Producer SDK GStreamer sink as a dynamic library on macOS, Ubuntu, Raspberry Pi, or Windows, execute the following command in the `kinesis-video-native-build` directory:

```
./gstreamer-plugin-install-script
```

After the sink is built, you can execute `gst-launch-1.0` from the following directory:

```
<YourSdkFolderPath>/kinesis-video-native-build/downloads/local/bin
```

You can either run `gst-launch-1.0` from this directory, or add it to the `PATH` environment variable:

```
$ export PATH=<YourSdkFolderPath>/kinesis-video-native-build/downloads/local/bin:$PATH
```

Add the library directory to your path so that the GStreamer plugin can be found:

```
export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=<YourSdkFolderPath>/kinesis-video-native-build/downloads/local/lib:$GST_PLUGIN_PATH
```

Set the library path for the SDK:

```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<YourSdkFolderPath>/kinesis-video-native-build/downloads/local/lib
```

## Run the GStreamer Element<a name="examples-gstreamer-plugin-run"></a>

To run GStreamer with the Kinesis Video Streams Producer SDK element as a sink, execute the `gst-launch-1.0` command\. Use settings that are appropriate for the GStreamer plugin to useâ€”for example, [v412src](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-good/html/gst-plugins-good-plugins-v4l2src.html) for v412 devices on Linux systems, or [rtspsrc](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-good/html/gst-plugins-good-plugins-rtspsrc.html) for RTSP devices\. Specify `kvssink` as the sink \(final destination of the pipeline\) to send video to the Producer SDK\. 

The `kvssink` element has the following required parameters:
+ `stream-name`: The name of the destination Kinesis video stream\.
+ `storage-size`: The storage size of the device in kilobytes\. For information about configuring device storage, see [StorageInfo](producer-reference-structures-producer.md#producer-reference-structures-producer-storageinfo)\.
+ `access-key`: The AWS access key that is used to access Kinesis Video Streams\. You must provide either this parameter or `credential-path`\.
+ `secret-key`: The AWS secret key that is used to access Kinesis Video Streams\. You must provide either this parameter or `credential-path`\.
+ `credential-path`: A path to a file containing your credentials for accessing Kinesis Video Streams\. For example credential files, see [Sample Static Credential](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-cpp/blob/master/kinesis-video-gstreamer-plugin/sample_static_credential) and [Sample Rotating Credential](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-cpp/blob/master/kinesis-video-gstreamer-plugin/sample_rotating_credential)\. For more information on rotating credentials, see [Managing Access Keys for IAM Users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html)\. You must provide either this parameter or `access-key` and `secret-key`\.

For information about `kvssink` optional parameters, see [GStreamer Element Parameter Reference](examples-gstreamer-plugin-parameters.md)\.

For the latest information about GStreamer plugins and parameters, see [GStreamer Plugins](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/), or execute the following command to list options:

```
gst-inspect-1.0 kvssink
```

## Run the GStreamer Element in a Docker Container<a name="examples-gstreamer-plugin-docker"></a>

Docker is a platform for developing, deploying, and running applications using containers\. Using Docker to create the GStreamer pipeline standardizes the operating environment for Kinesis Video Streams, which greatly simplifies building and executing the application\.

To install and configure Docker, see the following:
+ [Docker download instructions](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download)
+ [Getting started with Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)

After installing Docker, you can download the Kinesis Video Streams C\+\+ Producer SDK \(and GStreamer plugin\) from Amazon Elastic Container Registry using the `docker pull` command\.

To run GStreamer with the Kinesis Video Streams Producer SDK element as a sink in a Docker container, do the following:

**Topics**
+ [Authenticate your Docker Client](#examples-gstreamer-plugin-docker-authenticate)
+ [Download the Docker Image for Ubuntu, macOS, Windows, or Raspberry Pi](#examples-gstreamer-plugin-docker-download)
+ [Run the Docker Image](#examples-gstreamer-plugin-docker-run)

### Authenticate your Docker Client<a name="examples-gstreamer-plugin-docker-authenticate"></a>

Authenticate your Docker client to the Amazon ECR registry that you intend to pull your image from\. You must get authentication tokens for each registry used, and the tokens are valid for 12 hours\. For more information, see [Registry Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/Registries.html#registry_auth) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Registry User Guide*\.

**Example : Authenticate with Amazon ECR**  

```
aws ecr get-login --no-include-email --region us-west-2 --registry-ids 546150905175
```
The preceding command produces output similar to the following:  

```
docker login -u AWS -p <Password>   https://YourAccountId.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
```
The resulting output is a Docker login command that you use to authenticate your Docker client to your Amazon ECR registry\. 

### Download the Docker Image for Ubuntu, macOS, Windows, or Raspberry Pi<a name="examples-gstreamer-plugin-docker-download"></a>

Download the Docker image to your Docker environment using one the following commands, depending on your operating system:

#### Download the Docker Image for Ubuntu<a name="examples-gstreamer-plugin-docker-download-ubuntu"></a>

```
sudo docker pull 546150905175.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kinesis-video-producer-sdk-cpp-amazon-linux:latest
```

#### Download the Docker Image for macOS<a name="examples-gstreamer-plugin-docker-download-macos"></a>

```
sudo docker pull 546150905175.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kinesis-video-producer-sdk-cpp-amazon-linux:latest
```

#### Download the Docker Image for Windows<a name="examples-gstreamer-plugin-docker-download-windows"></a>

```
docker pull 546150905175.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kinesis-video-producer-sdk-cpp-amazon-windows:latest
```

#### Download the Docker Image for Raspberry Pi<a name="examples-gstreamer-plugin-docker-download-rpi"></a>

```
sudo docker pull 546150905175.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kinesis-video-producer-sdk-cpp-raspberry-pi:latest
```

To verify that the image was successfully added, use the following command:

```
docker images
```

### Run the Docker Image<a name="examples-gstreamer-plugin-docker-run"></a>

Use one of the following commands to run the Docker image, depending on your operating system:

#### Run the Docker Image on Ubuntu<a name="examples-gstreamer-plugin-docker-run-ubuntu"></a>

```
sudo docker run -it --network="host" --device=/dev/video0 546150905175
.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kinesis-video-producer-sdk-cpp-amazon-linux /bin/bash
```

#### Run the Docker Image on macOS<a name="examples-gstreamer-plugin-docker-run-macos"></a>

```
sudo docker run -it --network="host" 546150905175.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kinesis-video-producer-sdk-cpp-amazon-linux /bin/bash
```

#### Run the Docker Image on Windows<a name="examples-gstreamer-plugin-docker-run-windows"></a>

```
docker run -it 546150905175.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kinesis-video-producer-sdk-cpp-windows <AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID> <AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY> <RTSP_URL> <STREAM_NAME>
```

#### Run the Docker Image on Raspberry Pi<a name="examples-gstreamer-plugin-docker-run-rpi"></a>

```
sudo docker run -it --device=/dev/video0 --device=/dev/vchiq -v /opt/vc:/opt/vc 546150905175
.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kinesis-video-producer-sdk-cpp-raspberry-pi /bin/bash
```

Docker launches the container, and presents you with a command prompt for executing commands within the container\.

In the container, set the environment variables using the following command:

```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/awssdk/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-cpp/kinesis-video-native-build/downloads/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PATH=/opt/awssdk/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-cpp/kinesis-video-native-build/downloads/local/bin:$PATH
export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=/opt/awssdk/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-cpp/kinesis-video-native-build/downloads/local/lib:$GST_PLUGIN_PATH
```

Start streaming from the camera using the `gst-launch-1.0` command that is appropriate for your device\. 

**Note**  
On macOS, you can only stream video from a network camera when running GStreamer in a Docker container\. Streaming video from a USB camera on macOS in a Docker container is not supported\. 

For examples of using the `gst-launch-1.0` command to connect to a local web camera or a network RTSP camera, see [Launch Commands](#examples-gstreamer-plugin-launch)\.
