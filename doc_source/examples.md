## Prerequisites<a name="examples-prerequisites"></a>

+ In the sample code, you provide credentials by specifying a profile that you set in your AWS credentials profile file, or by providing credentials in the Java system properties of your integrated development environment \(IDE\)\. So if you haven't already done so, you must first set up your credentials\. For more information, see [Set up AWS Credentials and Region for Development ](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-credentials.html)\.

+ We recommend that you use a Java IDE to view and run the code, such as one of the following:

  + [Eclipse Java Neon](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/neon3)

  + [JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
