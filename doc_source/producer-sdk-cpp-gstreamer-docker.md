# Using the C\+\+ Producer SDK as a GStreamer Plugin in a Docker Container<a name="producer-sdk-cpp-gstreamer-docker"></a>

[GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) is a popular media framework used by a multitude of cameras and video sources to create custom media pipelines by combining modular plugins\. The Kinesis Video Streams GStreamer plugin greatly simplifies the integration of your existing GStreamer media pipeline with Kinesis Video Streams\. 

In addition, using [Docker]() to create the GStreamer pipeline standardizes the operating environment for Kinesis Video Streams, which greatly simplifies building and executing the application\.
